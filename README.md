# Vaccination Service for Digital Village
This is a web app deployed on __Microsoft Azure__ that provides an easy vaccination management service for the village administration as part of the village digitization super-project.
(Entire work record on https://gitlab.com/DASS2k22/DASS2K22-Team-10)

## About
Digital Village, as the name suggests is a project which aims to digitize most(if not all) of
villageâ€™s records, information communication and daily functioning. To achieve this, we shall
build a Mobile App. The app will be capable of hosting and notifying the members with village
related news, relevant government schemes and current affairs, providing personal portals to store
data like bills, payments, etc. In the current scenario, this will track, edit, update etc the Covid
Vaccination details of every member in the village. Additionally analysis updates related to the
current activity, say spread of the new Covid variant shall be published so as to also work as a
holistic local news medium. This way, the app shall serve the purpose of an all-in-one platform
customized to suit the needs of the rural community in an area.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
