## About
Digital Village, as the name suggests is a project which aims to digitize most(if not all) of
villageâ€™s records, information communication and daily functioning. To achieve this, we shall
build a Mobile App. The app will be capable of hosting and notifying the members with village
related news, relevant government schemes and current affairs, providing personal portals to store
data like bills, payments, etc. In the current scenario, this will track, edit, update etc the Covid
Vaccination details of every member in the village. Additionally analysis updates related to the
current activity, say spread of the new Covid variant shall be published so as to also work as a
holistic local news medium. This way, the app shall serve the purpose of an all-in-one platform
customized to suit the needs of the rural community in an area.
